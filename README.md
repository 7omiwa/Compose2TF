# Compose2TF

This program Converts `docker-compose.yml` files to Terraform HCL using the [kreuzwerker/docker](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kreuzwerker/docker/latest/docs) provider.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- PyYAML

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project structure

```
│-  compose2tf.py
│-  docker-compose.yml # its Recommended your Docker-Compose sit here but you can adjust in the Run command to specify dir 
│-  README.md
│-  requirements.txt
│

```

## Usage

### Basic

```bash
python compose2tf.py -f docker-compose.yml
```

Outputs `main.tf` in the current directory.

### With an override or prod file

Pass multiple `-f` flags. Files are merged left to right — later files override earlier ones, the same way Docker Compose handles them.

```bash
python compose2tf.py -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml
```

When a file matching `*.prod.yml`, `*.prod.yaml`, `*.override.yml`, `*.override.yaml`, `*.staging.yml`, or `*.staging.yaml` is detected, a `terraform.tfvars` file is generated automatically.

### All options

```bash
python compose2tf.py \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.prod.yml \
  -o main.tf \
  --tfvars prod.tfvars \
  --no-banner
```

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-f`, `--file` | Yes | — | Path to a compose file. Repeat for multiple files. |
| `-o`, `--output` | No | `main.tf` | Output path for the generated Terraform file. |
| `--tfvars` | No | auto-detected | Path to write a `.tfvars` template. Auto-set to `terraform.tfvars` when a prod/override file is present. |
| `--no-banner` | No | off | Suppress the ASCII art banner. |

## What gets converted

### Services

Each service becomes a `docker_image` resource and a `docker_container` resource.

Supported fields:

- `image`
- `build` — short form (`build: ./dir`) and long form (`context`, `dockerfile`, `args`)
- `ports` — short, host-bound (`127.0.0.1:8080:80`), and variable syntax (`${PORT:-8080}`)
- `environment` — list and dict forms
- `volumes` — short, long, named, host-path, and read-only
- `networks`
- `depends_on` — list and service-condition map forms
- `restart`
- `command`
- `healthcheck`

### Volumes

Top-level named volumes become `docker_volume` resources and are referenced by name from containers.

### Networks

Top-level named networks become `docker_network` resources.

### Environment variable interpolation

Compose variables are converted to Terraform input variables:

| Compose | Terraform |
|---|---|
| `${DB_NAME:-marketly}` | `var.db_name` with `default = "marketly"` |
| `${DB_PASSWORD}` | `var.db_password` with no default |

A `variable` block is generated for every unique variable found across all environment values and command strings.

### Build context

Services with a `build:` block get a `build {}` block in their `docker_image` resource instead of a registry pull. `keep_locally` is set to `true` so Terraform does not destroy locally built images on teardown.

```hcl
resource "docker_image" "auth" {
  name         = "auth"
  keep_locally = true
  build {
    context    = "."
    dockerfile = "cmd/auth/Dockerfile"
  }
}
```

## Output files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `main.tf` | Generated Terraform configuration (or whatever `-o` is set to). |
| `terraform.tfvars` | Variable values template, generated when a prod/override file is passed or `--tfvars` is set. Fill in any `"CHANGE_ME"` values before applying. |
| `merged-compose.yml` | The result of merging all input files. Useful for debugging unexpected output. |

## After conversion

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

# With a tfvars file
terraform apply -var-file=prod.tfvars
```

## Limitations

- The Docker provider manages containers on the machine where Terraform runs. This tool is suited for single-host deployments, not multi-host orchestration (use ECS, Kubernetes, or Nomad resources for that).
- `env_file:` references are noted but not inlined — values loaded from `.env` files at runtime are not visible to the converter.
- `deploy:` (Swarm mode) fields are ignored.
- All generated variable types are `string`. If your Terraform configuration needs numeric or boolean variables, adjust the generated blocks manually.
